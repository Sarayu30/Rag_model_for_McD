# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

## Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines information retrieval and generative modeling to answer user queries based on a nutritional dataset. The system uses Sentence Transformers for embedding retrieval and T5 for generating coherent responses.

## Features

- Dynamic Query Handling: Responds to user queries with contextually relevant answers.
- Contextual Relevance: Retrieves specific information from the dataset to enhance response accuracy.
- Interactive Interface: Engages users in a conversation-like manner through an interactive loop.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `torch`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `transformers`
  - `sklearn`
  - `datasets` (if needed for specific datasets)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas torch sentence-transformers transformers scikit-learn datasets
```

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **McDonald's Menu Nutrition** dataset, which provides nutritional information about various menu items. You can download it from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/mcdonalds-nutrition/data) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rag-system.git
cd rag-system
```

2. Update the dataset path in the code:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/McDonaldsMenuNutritionV2.csv')
```

3. Run the application:

```bash
python rag_system.py
```

4. Interact with the system by entering your queries.

## Example Queries

- "What are the calories in a cheeseburger?"
- "How much protein does a Quarter Pounder with Cheese have?"
